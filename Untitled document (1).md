# SIWES Connect — Product Requirements Document

## 1\. Overview

Problem: 400-level IT students struggle to find verified, legitimate IT placement (SIWES-style) opportunities. The process today is informal, unverified, and disconnected — students rely on word-of-mouth or unverified listings, companies have no structured way to reach qualified students, and there's no accountability once a placement starts.  
Solution: SIWES Connect is a platform that connects verified companies offering IT placements with verified 400-level students, providing matched discovery, structured applications, in-app status tracking, and support through the placement period.  
Vision statement: Bridge the gap between university walls and industry by making IT placement discovery verified, transparent, and accountable — for both students and companies.

## 2\. Target Users

* Primary: 400-level IT students seeking verified placement opportunities  
* Secondary: Companies looking to source screened, qualified IT interns  
* Platform owner (you): Verifies both sides and moderates trust on the platform

## 3\. Core Value Proposition

* Students get verified, real openings — not scams or unpaid dead ends discovered too late  
* Companies get pre-screened, eligible candidates matched to their actual criteria  
* Both sides get visibility into where things stand, instead of the current silence-and-guesswork norm

### 4.8 Business Model

* Free for all users at launch  
* Monetization deferred until usage data and scale justify a model (e.g., premium company features, featured listings)

## 5\. Explicitly Out of Scope (v1)

* No university/placement-office access or dashboard — platform operates independently of institutions  
* Stipend/compensation is not disclosed on postings — discussed off-app during interviews  
* No in-app messaging or interview scheduling — handled off-platform  
* No third-party/industry-body verification — you are the sole verifier at this stage

## 6\. Go-to-Market / Onboarding Strategy

* Launch narrow: one department, one student cohort  
* Personally recruit 15–20 companies with an existing history of taking interns  
* Onboard students through direct/warm channels (class groups, personal network) rather than public launch  
* Validate the full loop (verified posting → matched application → status tracking → placement) before expanding to more departments or universities

## 7\. Suggested Success Metrics

* Number of verified companies with active postings  
* Number of verified students with completed profiles  
* Application-to-shortlist conversion rate  
* Application-to-placement conversion rate  
* Report volume and resolution time (trust health indicator)

## 8\. Phased Roadmap

Phase 1 (Launch/MVP)

* Company \+ student verification  
* Hybrid discovery feed with custom criteria  
* Application flow with status tracking (capped at 5 active applications)  
* Student profile (basic \+ skills \+ CV)  
* Two-way ratings, report button  
* Core notifications (status change, new match, report acknowledgment)

Phase 2

* Full placement monitoring suite (logbook, attendance, supervisor evaluation, visit scheduling)  
* Logbook/evaluation reminder notifications  
* Possible: student-reported stipend info surfaced via post-placement reviews

Phase 3 (Future consideration)

* Monetization (premium features for companies)  
* Expansion to additional universities/departments  
* Potential industry-body verification layer as trust signal at scale
